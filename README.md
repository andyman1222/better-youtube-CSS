# better-youtube-CSS
Google has no clue on how to make good CSS, so I am working on fixing it.

Google's latest changes to Youtube have made an absolutely awful UI experience, especially on average display PCs. Every change they make seems to make everything unnecessarily bigger and more bloated.

Luckily, this is all CSS changes, and there are tools in web browsers to override the CSS of any webpage.
